# Mini-Libary-Project-Python

Statement:- The task is to create an “Online Library Management System”. For this, you have to create a library class that includes the following methods: Displaybook() : To display the available books Lendbook(): To lend a book to a user Addbook(): To add a book to the library Returnbook(): To return the book to the library. As you have created a library class, now you will create an object and pass the following parameters in the constructor. HarryLibrary=Library(listofbooks, library_name) After that, create a main function and run an infinite while loop that asks the users for their input that whether they want to display, lend, add or return a book.
